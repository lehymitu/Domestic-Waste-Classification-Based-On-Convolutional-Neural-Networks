# Domestic-Waste-Classification-Based-On-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
## General info
This project presents a waste classification system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help protect the environment by classifying waste into six types which are cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic and organic waste. Results show that the model achieved a high accuracy of about 92.5% on the testing set, but there were still some incorrect classifications due to the unique points between classes.

### Dataset
In total, there are 403 images of Cardboard, 601 images of Glass, 510 images of Metal, 694 images of Paper, 582 images of Plastic and 542 images of Organic. 
It comes from Kaggle and can be find [here](https://kaggle.com/datasets/c099c171c6e7b29df8b8bd38d4898aaedb16679b70917b98e2911edaa8e027f4).


## Motivation
The aim of the project is waste classification by using Deep Neural Networks. The dataset contains various waste images of cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic and organic waste. I built model to classify which type of waste. I used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Project includes:

* Waste classification model - **wasteclassification.h5**
* Waste Classification interface - **wasteclassification.ipynb**
 
## Technologies

The project is created with:
* Python 3.10
* libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, pillow, numpy, pandas, seaborn

**Running the project:**

This project use Google Colab or Kaggle (coding) and Visual Studio Code (interface)
